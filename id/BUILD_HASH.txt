CORPIFORM BUILD HASH

This file records the cryptographic hash of the exact source tree
used to build and operate this instance of CORPIFORM.

---

BUILD_HASH: UNSET

---

## RULES

- The BUILD_HASH is computed over the complete, canonical source tree.
- The hash MUST be generated using a cryptographically secure algorithm.
- The hash MUST be written once and never modified.
- A missing or UNSET hash indicates a non-final, non-authoritative build.

---

## VALIDITY

A BUILD_HASH is valid only if:

- it matches the verified source tree
- it corresponds to a declared VERSION
- it is referenced by execution receipts
- it is traceable in the ledger

---

## INVALIDATION

If this file is missing, altered, or mismatched:

- CORPIFORM MUST refuse all execution
- CORPIFORM MUST be treated as compromised

---

## DECLARATION

This BUILD_HASH binds code to reality.

Without it, CORPIFORM does not exist.
