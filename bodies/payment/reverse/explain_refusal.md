# PAYMENT REVERSAL — REFUSAL

Payment reversals are **explicitly forbidden** in CORPIFORM.

---

## REASON

CORPIFORM performs **irreversible external actions** only when
explicit authority is granted in advance.

Payment reversal implies:
- retrospective authority
- implicit error correction
- post-hoc intent inference

These are forbidden.

---

## POLICY

- No refunds
- No chargebacks
- No reversal execution paths
- No conditional compensation logic

Any attempt to reverse a payment MUST be refused.

---

## CONSEQUENCE

If reversal is required:

- a new authority seal must be issued
- a separate compensating transfer must be executed
- the original transfer remains a historical fact

History is not undone.

---

## DECLARATION

This refusal is final.

Payment reversals do not exist in CORPIFORM.
