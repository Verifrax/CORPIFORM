# ARTIFACT RETRACTION — REFUSAL

Artifact retraction is **explicitly forbidden** in CORPIFORM.

---

## REASON

CORPIFORM performs **irreversible disclosure** under explicit authority.

Retraction implies:
- post-hoc authority
- historical mutation
- denial of prior fact

These are forbidden.

---

## POLICY

- No deletion of published artifacts
- No unpublishing
- No silent removal
- No retroactive correction

Once published, an artifact exists as fact.

---

## CONSEQUENCE

If an artifact must be withdrawn:

- a new artifact may be published clarifying or superseding the prior one
- the original artifact remains accessible
- history is preserved

---

## DECLARATION

This refusal is final.

Published artifacts are permanent.
