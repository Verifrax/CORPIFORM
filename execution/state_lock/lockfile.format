LOCKFILE FORMAT

Each lockfile represents a single execution attempt for a command.

---

FILENAME
<command_id>.lock

---

CONTENTS
command_id=<string>
acquired_at=<UTC ISO-8601 timestamp>

---

SEMANTICS

- A lockfile is created exactly once per command_id.
- Presence of a lockfile means the command has already been attempted.
- Lockfiles MUST NOT be modified after creation.
- Lockfiles MUST NOT be overwritten.
- Lockfiles MUST NOT be reused for other commands.

---

LIFECYCLE

1. Created before execution attempt.
2. Remains after successful execution.
3. May be removed only on explicit denial path.
4. Never recreated for the same command_id.

---

INVALIDATION

If a lockfile is missing, malformed, or ambiguous:
- execution MUST be refused
- the system MUST be treated as compromised

---

DECLARATION

Lockfiles enforce execute-once reality.

Without them, CORPIFORM must not act.
